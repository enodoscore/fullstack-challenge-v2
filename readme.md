## Submission
- This assessment contains three exercises.
  - coding_challenge
  - sql_challenge
  - rest_challenge
- You have four hours to submit this assessment.
- If you finish your solution in less than two hours, try to polish it as much as you can.
- Solution can be polished in many ways. Just apply your knowledge on coding best practices and project configuration cleaning.
- Send back your solution in a ZIP-compressed file, ensuring it does NOT contain any binary file, such as .EXE ones.
- This challenges contain a boilerplate (using Python3 and SQLite3) so you can focus on solving the problems. Feel free to discard it and use your own.

- REST Challenge: [link](rest_challenge/readme.md)
## [Optional] Boilerplate Prerequisites

**Note: This part is only required if you decided to use the provided Boilerplate**

You need Python 3.6 or later.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3-pip python3.6-venv python3.6-dev

Recommended to update before running the above command.

    $ sudo apt-get update

For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, packages are available at

http://www.python.org/getit/

Once you're done installing Python 3, check that it install correctly.

    $ python --version
    Python 3.6

Check that PIP is install as well

    $ pip3 --version
    pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip (python 3.6)

If its not installed you can run: 

    $ sudo apt-get python3-pip

### Create Python Virtual Environment

    $ python3.6 -m venv venv

### Load Python Virtual Environment

    $ source venv/bin/activate

## Run Boilerplate

### Coding Challenge

    $ python ./coding_challenge/run.py

### SQL Challenge

    $ python ./coding_challenge/run.py
